# Eight-directions
Eight directions of belonging Description: There are 8 constitutions of people's bodies. They are Hepatonia, Cholecystonia, Pancreotonia, Gastrotonia, Pulmotonia, Colonotonia, Renotonia, and Vesicotonia. In different senses, this leads to northeast, east, southeast, south, southwest, west, northwest, and north. They have the opposite nature of facing each other in the opposite direction.

Therefore, they are paired as follows.
Hepatonia-Pulmotonia
Cholecystonia-Colonotonia
Pancreotonia-Renotonia
Gastrotonia-Vesicotonia

Here, a pair communicates with the couple unit. If a man determines his constitution, the spouse must be identified as his partner's constitution at the same time or later and connected as a pair. This is because a couple can meet with the opposite constitution and marry. This has to do with one of the couples likes vegetarianism and the other loves meat. It's like one side progresses to COVID-19 as severe, but the other side never progresses to severe disease. It's like the one side likes cold ice and the other side likes hot food. Even if the couple determines their constitution differently, the result of the determination as a couple will continue. This would be a simple self-proof.
